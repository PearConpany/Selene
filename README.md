# Selene: Programming for Everyone

Selene is a revolutionary programming language designed to make coding accessible to everyone, especially beginners. It bridges the gap between natural language and traditional programming, allowing you to write code by simply having a conversation. Selene is an ideal tool for students and teachers in the world of programming education.

## The Problem: Making Programming Accessible

Traditional programming languages often have a steep learning curve, filled with complex syntax and abstract concepts. This can be intimidating for newcomers and create a barrier to entry for those who want to bring their ideas to life through code. Many students are introduced to programming through visual block-based languages, but find the transition to text-based languages like Python challenging. Selene provides a stepping stone, easing this transition. Selene aims to solve this by providing a more intuitive and user-friendly approach to programming.

## Features

Selene empowers users with a range of features designed for ease of use and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for learning and teaching programming:

*   **Conversational Programming:** Write code in plain Spanish or English. Its syntax is so natural that it looks like a dialogue, making it easy for those who have never programmed to understand and use. Selene understands your instructions and translates them into executable actions.
*   **Python-Based Execution:** Under the hood, Selene leverages the power and versatility of Python, giving you access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools. This allows students to gradually become familiar with Python's capabilities.
*   **Common Programming Constructs:** Selene supports essential programming concepts, including:
    *   Importing libraries
    *   Defining and calling functions
    *   Working with lists
    *   Implementing loops
    *   Introducing pauses or delays in execution
*   **Command-Line Interpreter (REPL):** Experiment with Selene interactively through its Read-Eval-Print Loop, perfect for quick tests and learning.
*   **`.se` Script Execution:** Write your Selene programs in `.se` files and execute them directly, allowing for the creation of more complex projects.
*   **Luna Wizard - Graphical IDE:** For a more visual experience, Selene offers the Luna Wizard, a graphical integrated development environment with features like:
    *   Automatic input windows for user interaction, simplifying how programs get data.
    *   A welcoming splash screen.
    *   Support for custom icons.
    *   Future integration with Arduino for physical computing projects, opening doors to robotics and electronics education.
*   **Single Executable Distribution:** Selene is distributed as a single executable, making it easy to install and run without complex setup procedures, ideal for classroom environments.
